//it's good practice not to re-use the same global.variables.
//it might lead to messy results otherwise.

//just in case. I had trouble with them before...

toggleCellAtScreen(mouse_x,mouse_y);
 //because we changed it now

//show_message("Element will be painted at "+string(paint_x)+","+string(paint_y));
